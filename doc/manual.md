#Concepts Manual	


Introduction
============

*Concepts* are a formal method of specifying asynchronous circuits. With
concepts, one can describe behaviours of a circuit and its environment
at various levels, with the aim of defining the behaviours in terms of
gates, protocols or simple signal interactions. Using this method, one
can split a design into scenarios, based on operational modes,
individual functions, or any other method a user decides. These can be
specified separately, using concepts, and then combined to provide a
full system specification. Through this, reuse is promoted, allowing
concepts to be reused between scenarios and even entire designs. More
information on the theory of concepts can be found
in, the latest version of which can be found
[here](https://github.com/tuura/concepts-article/releases).

In this document, we will discuss the associated tool for concepts. This
open source tool is written in *Haskell*, and contains both the library
for concepts, including abstract concepts and circuit concepts built
upon the abstract, and a tool for translating concepts into *Signal
Transition Graphs* (STGs). These
are commonly used for the specification, verification and synthesis of
asynchronous control circuits in the academic community, and they are
supported by multiple EDA tools, such as <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Petrify</span></span>,
<span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mpsat</span></span>,
<span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Versify</span></span>,
<span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>,
and others. The aim of this tool is to design and debug concepts, and
then translate them to STGs, where they can be used with these tools.

The latest version of this tool, and this manual, can be found [in the
GitHub repo](https://github.com/tuura/concepts). Any bugs or issues
found with the tool can be reported here. This tool is also distributed
as a back-end tool for <span><spanstyle="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>. This version
of the concepts tool will be the latest version that works correctly
with <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>. The latest
version of <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, which also
features tools such as <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Petrify</span></span> and <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mpsat</span></span>, can be downloaded
from <http://workcraft.org/>.

Installation
============

The concepts tool, as well as <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> are available
for *Windows*, *Linux* and *Mac OS X*. The installation instructions for
all of these operating systems are the same. We will be referring to
directories using the
forward-slash character (’/’) as a separator, however for *Windows*,
replace this with a back-slash character (’\\’).

If choosing to use the concepts tool on its own, this must be downloaded
from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tuura/concepts). If you choose
to use this tool as part of <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, download this
from the [<span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
website](http://workcraft.org/). Once downloaded, extract the contents
of the folder, and move them to a directory you wish to run them from.

Concepts tool requirements
--------------------------

The concepts tool is written in *Haskell*, and uses *Stack* to install
the necessary compiler and dependencies. If necessary, please download
stack for your operating system, available from
<https://haskell.org/downloads#stack>, and follow the instructions to
install this.

Workcraft requirements
----------------------

<span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> is
written in Java, and the latest version of the *Java Runtime
Environment* (JRE) needs to be installed to run. This can be downloaded
from <http://java.com/en/download/>. If needed, download the JRE
installer, and follow the instructions to install this.

While the concepts tool is distributed with <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, it still needs
to be built by *stack* in order for it to be run. See
above for requirements for the concepts
tool.

Installing the tool
-------------------

Once either the concepts tool or <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> has been
extracted and moved to the desired directory, using command line,
navigate to the concepts tool directory, or if using <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, navigate to
the <span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
directory, and then navigate to the concepts tool directory, found in
`tools/concepts` (for *OS X*, the <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> directory is
located within the `Workcraft.app` contents folder. The concepts tool
will be found at `Contents/Resources/tools/concepts`.

Now, the process of installing the tool is the same, regardless of how
you aim to use the concepts tool. First of all, let’s setup stack. To do
this, run:

```
  $ stack setup
```

This will prepare stack to install the concepts tool. Now, to build and
install the concepts tool, simply run:

```
  $ stack build
```

If this process completes successfully, the tool will now be installed
and ready to be used.

Using the tool from command line
================================

With the tool installed, we can now start to use it to translate
concepts to STGs. We will begin by discussing how it is used from
command line. Usage as a back-end tool in <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> is discussed in
the next section.

The standard command for the tool is as follows:

```
  $ stack runghc <path-to-translate> <path-to-concepts-file> [--stack-yaml <path-to-stack-file>]
```

The three parts of this are as follows:

-   `stack` - This will ensure that the dependencies and compiler are
    installed when running.

-   `runghc` - This runs the translation function.

-   `<path-to-translate>` - This is file path pointing to the translate
    code file, which performs the necessary operations to translate
    concepts to STGs.

-   `<path-to-concepts-file>` - This is the path pointing to the file
    containing the concepts to be translated.

-   `[–stack-yaml <path-to-stack-file>]` - This is optional. If running
    the tool from outside of the directory, the path to the stack file
    needs to be given.

When running the concepts tool from command line, as long as the paths
to the translate code, the concepts file and the `stack.yaml` file are
correct, it doesn’t matter which directory the tool is run from. The
`stack.yaml` file is located in the base of the concepts directory.

Now, let’s use one of the examples included with the concepts tool to
show the usage. These can be found in the `examples` directory of the
concepts tool. For this section, we will assume that we are currently in
the concepts tool directory. The example we will use is the file titled
“`Celement_with_env_1.hs`”. This has the “.hs” file extension, as it is
in fact a file using Haskell code, and all files containing concepts
should feature this file extension. To translate this concepts file to
an STG, the following command must be run:

```
  $ stack runghc translate/Main.hs examples/Celement_with_env_1.hs
```

When the translation is complete, the tool will output the following:

```
  .model out
  .inputs A B
  .outputs C
  .internals
  .graph
  A0 A+
  A+ A1
  A1 A-
  A- A0
  B0 B+
  B+ B1
  B1 B-
  B- B0
  C0 C+
  C+ C1
  C1 C-
  C- C0
  A1 C+
  C+ A1
  B1 C+
  C+ B1
  C1 A-
  A- C1
  C1 B-
  B- C1
  A0 C-
  C- A0
  B0 C-
  C- B0
  C0 A+
  A+ C0
  C0 B+
  B+ C0
  .marking {A0 B0 C0}
  .end
```

This output is the STG representation in *.g* format. *.g* files are a
standard type used as input to tools, such as <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Petrify</span></span>, <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mpsat</span></span>, and <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>. Therefore,
this output can by copy-and-pasted into a file, and saved with the file
etension *.g*, and then used as input to these tools.

The concepts tool can be used in a similar way, ensuring that the file
paths to the translate code file, and the concepts input file, are
correct. A section below contains information on how to
layout a concepts file, to avoid as many errors as possible.

Any errors that occur during the translation process will produce errors
referring to the problematic lines of signals of the concepts that are
problematic.

Using the tool from <span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
=================================================================================================================

This section will discuss how to use the concepts tool from within
<span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>.
There are many other features of <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, both as part
of the STG plug in, some of which I will discuss in the context of
concepts here, and as part of other modelling formalisms. More
information on these can be found at <http://workcraft.org/>.

Translating and authoring concepts
----------------------------------

First of all, <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> must be
started. This can be done by running the start up script, located in the
<span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
directory in *Windows* and *Linux*. In *Windows*, this script is named
“`workcraft.bat`“. In *Linux*, it is simply ”`workcraft`". In *OS X*,
<span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> can
be started instead by double clicking the <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span> icon, which is
the app container for the necessary files.

When workcraft starts, you will be greeted by blank screen, as seen here:

![Workcraft immediately after starting.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/blank_workcraft_screenshot.svg)


Now, we need to open a new work, specifically a new STG work. Open the
“New work” dialog using the menu bar, `File -> Create work...`, or by
pressing `Ctrl-N` (`CMD-N` on *OS X*). This will bring up a menu as seen here:

![The create work window.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/new_work_screenshot.svg)

In this window, select “*Signal Transition Graph*’ and cick the “OK”
button at the bottom of the window. This will the open a blank workspace
in which we can create an STG, which will look similar this:

![A new STG workspace](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/new_stg_screenshot.svg)

Now, we can start translating concepts. To do this, first we need to
open the concepts dialog. This is done from the menu bar, by selecting
the “*Conversion*” menu, and then the “*Translate concepts...*” option.
The concepts dialog will look as shown here:

![The concepts dialog.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/concepts_dialog_screenshot.svg)

From within this dialog, one can write their own concepts, from the
default template, or open an existing
concepts file, with the *.hs* extension. When satisfied with the
concepts written, a user can choose to save the file, if not already
saved, and then translate these concepts.

![The concepts dialog with a concept file opened.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/concepts_dialog_Celement.svg)

This is the concepts dialog after
we have opened the Celement with environment example, named
“*Celement_with_env_1.hs*”, from the concepts tool examples
directory. Clicking translate at this point will produce an STG
representation of these concepts in the workspace.

![The STG produced from translating the concepts.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/concepts_translated.svg)

The translated concepts will look similar to in the above image.

Now, a user can choose to insert more concepts, make changes to this
STG, and once they are satisfied with it, can then perform various
functions on this STG. One can perform transformations, verifications,
simulations and synthesis on this STG using the menus within this
workspace now. Any further changes to this STG, based on the results of
these operations can be made to this STG or to the concepts file.

Importing concepts directly
---------------------------

In <span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
it is also possible to import concepts directly from a file, without
having to view the concepts first. This can be done from the “*File*”
menu, by selecting the “*Import...*” option.

![The STG produced from translating the concepts.](http://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/images/import_menu_screenshot.svg)

When importing concepts using this menu, ensure to set the “*Files of
Type*” option to “*Concepts file (.hs)*”, as shown in the image above.

Errors
------

If any errors are encountered during the translation process,
<span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>
will produce a helpful error message. This usually can tell you with
more detail what the issue that is causing the error is, but will ask
you to refer to <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>’s console
window for specific line numbers or signals which need to be corrected.
These errors will include whether a signal has not been declared as an
input or output, a signal has not had it’s initial state given, or even
that the concepts tool has not been installed correctly.

Writing concepts
=========================================

In this section, we will discuss how to write a concepts file. We will
use an example and go through it based on lines, explaining what is
necessary. For this example we will be using the same as example as in
previous sections, from the examples included with the concepts repo.
This is “*Celement_with_env_1.hs*”.

Concepts file layout
--------------------
```haskell

	module Concept where

	import Tuura.Concept.STG

	circuit a b c = interface <> outputRise <> inputFall <> outputFall <> inputRise <> initialState
	  where
    	interface = inputs [a, b] <> outputs [c]

	    outputRise = rise a ~> rise c <> rise b ~> rise c

    	inputFall = rise c ~> fall a <> rise c ~> fall b

	    outputFall = fall a ~> fall c <> fall b ~> fall c

    	inputRise = fall c ~> rise a <> fall c ~> rise b

	    initialState = initialise a False <> initialise b False <> initialise c False
```


The concepts file we will discuss is found in
image above. The following describes important
information about specific lines.

Line 1

This line must be included in all concept files, as the first line.
This ensures that when translating, this is recognised as a
concepts file.

Line 2

This must also remain in all concept files, before any concepts begin to
be defined. Importing this module means that the standard operators
and existing gates/protocols can be used.

Line 3

This is where a user can begin to define their concepts. “`circuit`” must
begin the line, but after this, a user can choose what characters
they wish to represent their signals. In this case, we use `a`, `b`
and `c`. Whatever number of signals appear in the system, each one
must have a character representation. Following the equals sign,
“=”, we now start defining concepts. Here, any form of concepts can
be used; signal-, gate- or protocol-level concepts. Or, a user can
define their own concepts below, following where, and include the
names of these concepts here. This can allow for a more concise and
easily understood definintion.

Line 4

This is simply “`where`”. This is used to separate the main concept
definition from the user-defined concepts. If a concept definition
does not need any user defined concepts, this `where`, and all
following lines can be omitted.

The lines discussed above are the basics of writing concepts. With this
information, a user can write concept files, but the following lines can
be used for ease-of-use, ease-of-understanding, and reuse. We will some
of the following lines in the context of the *Celement_with_env_1.hs*
file, but the information can be applied to any concept files. More
information on operators and built-in concepts can be found below.

Line 5

Interface is a concept defined to list the interfaces of the
signals, in otherwords, their type. Signals in this can be defined
as *inputs* or *outputs*. Every signal must have it’s type defined.
This can be done using the functions `inputs[x, y]` and
`outputs[p, q]`. Both of these functions can take a single signal,
“`[a]`”, or multiple signals in a comma separated list,
“`[x, y, z]`”.

Line 6

This contains a composition of two signal-level concepts. This uses
“`rise`” to signify a low-to-high signal transition.
“`~>`” signifies causality between two
signal transitions. “`<>`” is the composition operator. This is used
to compose any type of concepts.

Line 7

This also contains a composition of two signal-level concepts. Some are
the same as in Line 11, however, this also features “`fall`”, which
signifies a high-to-low transition of the signal this function
apllies to, in this case both `a` and `b` have included
falling transitions.

Lines 8 and 9

These are further concepts definitions.

Line 10

This is the definition of inital states for the signals in
this system. This is done by using the “`initialise`” function. This
takes a signal, and a Boolean value, and will set this signal’s
initial state to 0 if the Boolean value is False, and 1 if the
Boolean value is True. This is just one way of defining
initial states.

It is important to note that all defined concepts after Line 8 are part
of “`circuit`” definition, on Line 7. These user-defined concepts can be
used both within other user-defined concepts, and within the circuit
definition to be translated.

Built-in concepts
--------------------------------------------

There are several built-in concepts included in the library, for simple
functions, such as setting the initial state, and some standard useful
gate- and protocol-level concepts included for ease-of-use. We will list
the operators and concepts that are built-in to this tool in this
section, and discuss their usage.

`rise a`

This is used in conjunction with a signal, in this example, `a`. This is
used to show a low-to-high (0 -&gt; 1) transition of a signal.

`fall a`

This is the opposite of rise. Used in conjunction with a signal, `a` here,
is used to show a high-to-low (1 -&gt; 0) transition of a signal.

`~>`

This is used to show *causality*. This is usually used in conjunction
with `rise` and `fall`, to show that one signal transition, a cause,
will occur before another signal transition, effect. This doesn’t
force the effect to occur as soon as the cause has occurred, but
simply states that the cause will happen before the effect. It does
not suggest timing. One effect signal transition having multiple
cause signal transitions creates *AND-causality*. This means that
for the effect to occur, both causes must occur. For example:
`rise a ~> rise c <> rise b ~> rise c` 
will form a concept where both `rise a` and `rise b` must occur
before `rise c` can occur.

`~|~>`

This is used to show \emph{OR causality}. Similar to `~>`, however the 
transitions on left side of this arrow can be a list of causes, 
e.g `[rise a, rise b]`. The effect transition (on the right of the arrow)
must be a single signal transition. This will imply that only one of the
signal transitions in the cause list must occur in order for the effect 
to occur. With the previous example, the `rise a` transition alone can cause the effect. 

`<>`

This is the composition operator. This is used between two concepts to
compose them. To compose several concepts at once, include this
operator between all concepts, but not at the start and end of
these concepts.

`inputs [a, ...]`

This is used to define the interface of the included signal(s)
as input. It can be used to set the type of a single signal,
“`[a]`”, or multiple signals using a comma separated list,
“`[a, b, c]`”.

`outputs [a, ...]`

This is used to define the interface of the included signal(s)
as output. It can be used to set the type of a single signal,
“`[a]`”, or multiple signals using a comma separated list,
“`[a, b, c]`”.

`internals [a, ...]`

This is used to define the interface of the included signal(s)
as internal. It can be used to set the type of a single signal,
“`[a]`”, or multiple signals using a comma separated list,
“`[a, b, c]`”.

`initialise a *Bool*`

This is used to set a single signal’s initial state. The *Bool*, if True
will set the signals initial state to 1, or high. If False, the
initial state of the signal will be 0, or low.

`initialise0 [a, ...]`

This sets multiple signals initial states to 0, or low. Passed into this
concept can be a single signal, “`[a]`”, or several in a comma
separated list, “`[a, b, c]`”.

`initialise1 [a, ...]`

This sets multiple signals initial states to 1, or high. As with the
previous concept, the signals passed in to it can be a single
signal, “`[a]`”, or several in a comma separated list,
“`[a, b, c]`”.

`buffer a b`

This is a gate-level concept, used to show that the input signal (`a` in
this case) causes the output to transition in the same way (`b` in
this case).

`inverter a b`

This is a gate-level concept, used to show that the input signal (`a` in
this case) causes the opposite transition in the output signal (`b`
in this case).

`cElement a b c`

This is a gate-level concept, with two inputs (`a` and `b` in this case)
and one output (`c`). For the output to transition from low-to-high,
both inputs must have transitioned high. For the output to then
transition from high-to-low, both input signals must have already
transitioned low.

`handshake a b`

This is a protocol-level concept. The two signals passed into this
protocol form a handshake, where the second signal (`b` in
this case) follows the transitions of the first signal (`a` in
this case). For example, when `a` transitions high, `b` will
transition high at some point afterwards. When `a` transitions low
`b` will transition low if it is not already.

`handshake00 a b`

This is another protocol-level concept. The behaviours of the signals are
the same as in the standard `handshake` concepts, but this includes
initial states for the signals. For this concept, both signals will
be initialised to 0, or low.

`handshake11 a b`

This is another protocol-level concept. The behaviours of the signals are
the same as in the standard `handshake` concepts, but this includes
initial states for the signals. For this concept, both signals will
be initialised to 1, or high.

`me a b`

A protocol-level concepts. This concept defines *Mutual Exclusion*
between two signals. This means that when one of these signals is
high, the other cannot transition high.

`meElement r1 r2 g1 g2`

This is a gate-level concept to apply mutual exclusion. In this case,
there are four signals. Two are intputs (`r1` and `r2`), the other
two are outputs (`g1` and `g2`). `r1` transitioning high will cause
`g1` to go transition high, and this is the same for `r2` and `g2`,
however, `g1` and `g2` are mutually exclusive. The aim of this
concept is to ensure that the request signals, `r1` and `r2`, cause
their respective grant signals, `g1` and `g2`, to transition high
but never at the same time.

`andGate a b c`

This is a gate-level concept, using OR-causality to implement a 
standard AND gate. Signals `a` and `b`are inputs to the gate, 
and `c` is the output. Both `rise a` and `rise b` must occur for
`rise c` to occur. Following this, either `fall a` or `fall b` must 
occur for `fall c` to occur.
  
`orGate a b c`

This is a gate-level concept, using OR-causality to implement a 
standard OR gate. Signals `a` and `b` are inputs to the gate, and 
`c` is the output. Either `rise a` or `rise b` must occur for 
`rise c` to occur. Following this, both `fall a`and `fall b` must 
occur for `fall c` to occur. 
  

There are many operators and concepts. With these built-in concepts, we
beleive that it is possible to generate STGs of various sizes and
complexities using these, and user-defined concepts.

We are always aiming to add more concepts to the library. Some that are
to be added can be found in the next section. Further
suggestions can be added to [the issue list in the github
repo](https://github.com/tuura/concepts/issues), where these can be
discussed.

Features to be implemented
======================================================

Some features which we aim to be stanard functionality of the concepts
tool are not implemented yet for various reasons. These will be
displayed here. We will also try and explain a work-around to use until
these features are implemented.

Conversations on these features can be found [in the list of issues in
the github repo](https://github.com/tuura/concepts/issues). Any further
problems or ideas for features can also be reported here.

Define signal names for translated concepts
-------------------------------------------

Github issue: <https://github.com/tuura/concepts/issues/35>

Currently, when concepts are translated, regardless of the names of
signals used in the concept definition, the STG translated will have
signals, starting at ’`A`’ and following the alphabet, only up to the
number of signals in the system. For example, a concept containing 5
signals when translated will produce a STG containing signals ’`A`’,
’`B`’, ’`C`’, ’`D`’ and ’`E`’. These signals will be in the order of the
signals defined in the `circuit`. For example, if the circuit definition
is:

`circuit x y z = ...`

the signals in the translated STG will be ’`A`’ in place of ’`x`’, ’`B`’
in place of ’`y`’ and ’`C`’ in place of ’`Z`’. The signal names will not
affect their type, or the specification in any-way.
A work-around for this when used in command line is unfortunatley
complicated. The *.g* file output by the tool can be edited, replacing,
for example, all ’`A`’ signals with the desired signal name. If using
the tool with <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Workcraft</span></span>, this becomes
somewhat easier. The STG when imported can be manipulated much more
easily. The signals can have their names changed by selecting them and
changing the property. Signals with the same name can be selected
together (`shift-left mouse button`) and their name can be edited at
once. This, however, is still not as simple as the singal names being
included in the translation, and we aim to implement this feature soon.

User-defined concepts to be reused without re-definition
--------------------------------------------------------

Github issue: <https://github.com/tuura/concepts/issues/36>

It is our aim to allow a user to define their own concepts to build a
scenario STG, and then re-use the definition of some of their own
concepts without having to re-define any of these concepts, to build
another scenario STG, or in any other concept definition.

This feature has not been implemented in this version of the concepts
tool. This may require some new form of definition of these concepts, in
order to be reused. It may also require the import of a concept file
including the original concept definition. When the feature has been
implemented, information on how to use this feature will be included in
this manual.
A work-around for this is simply to copy-and-paste the previous concept
definition into the new concept file which would require this concept.
